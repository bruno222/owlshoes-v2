- A full size page, divided in 3 divs, 
- Each div contains the real-time transcript of a conversation between an Agent and a VoiceBot. 
- Each div will have 2 buttons below: [Give instructions] and [Hijack call]
- Each Div can have 2 states: Either it is an ONGOING chat or it is an WAITING-FOR-INSTRUCTIONS chat.
- When WAITING-FOR-INSTRUCTIONS, the div will call the attention of the Agent with a different color.
- On the top, add a colorful logo "Hackathon 2024 Vegas - Team XYZ"

-----

- Make these 3 divs full height

- Instead of saying "[Real-time transcript goes here]", add example of a Chat, including "Customer:" and "Bot:" headers to distinguish between them. Make the transcript example a big enough to show scroll bar.

- For every new message into the transcript, make the scrollbar scroll down automatically, showing always the latest message.

on the right side of this title, add the sentiment analysis of the customer, it can have 5 states: Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positve, Very Positive. Have a different color for each sentiment, in an gradient way. Do it in a way that the Agent who is looking this screen can clearly see the sentiment of the customer.
